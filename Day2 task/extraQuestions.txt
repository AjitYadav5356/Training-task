CSS

a.Explain the different ways in which CSS can be applied to HTML, what is the preferred way and why.
  We can apply CSS to HTML in three ways.
  1.Inline CSS
	We use this we want to apply rules to any specific element and when we want to apply only one rule to that element.
 2.Internal CSS
     In this we define CSS in head section of HTML.we use this method when we want to apply less CSS or when we want to apply
     these CSS to only that page. As we cann't reuse this CSS.
3. External CSS
    In this method we create seperate file for css and link this file to HTML using link tag in head of HTML file. We use this
    method when size of css property is very large or we can use same css prrperty to diffrenent pages.

b.What are different CSS selectors, with example explain Element, Class and Id selectors.

   element selector(p): we can directly select element apply css on that.
   id selector(#id) : Id selector used id attribute of an html element to select a specific element
   class selector(.) : class selector selects html elements with a specific class attribute.
   group selector(p,h3) : we can group the selectors with same style definitions.
   universal selector(*) : this will select all the element on the page.
